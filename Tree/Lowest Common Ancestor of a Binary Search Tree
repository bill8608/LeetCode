Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

   0      _4       7       9
         /  \
         3   5
For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 2 and 8 is 6. Another example is LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

Version 1: Use the same coding of Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

Version2: Use the binary search tree' characteristic: All left subtrees's elements smaller than root and all right subtrees' elements larger than root
/**

    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        while ((root.val - p.val) * (root.val - q.val) > 0) {
            root = p.val < root.val ? root.left : root.right;
